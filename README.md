# ForeCast_Of_Churn_Telecom_Company

In this project, we aim to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to predict customer churn for a Telecom Operator Interconnect Company. The objective is to identify which customers are likely to stay or leave. We will assess the performance of the models using AUC-ROC and accuracy as key evaluation metrics. The 'Enddate' column will serve as the target variable, indicating whether a customer has left the service. This approach will help the company make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention strategies.
